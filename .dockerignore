# This .dockerignore file only works with docker buildkit. Wildcard exclusion patterns are
# utterly broken and misdocumented in vanilla docker.
# 
# See: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43232
#
# This is an allow-list based .dockerignore file.
#
# - First of all, ignore everything.
# - Then, allow only the files that are needed for the build.
#
# We add only the absolute minimal set of files needed for the build. For instance,
# we can entirely skip any tsconfig because we use `tsup` for the server build.
*

# Allow workspace root files.
